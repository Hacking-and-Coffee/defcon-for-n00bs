# defcon-for-n00bs
DEF CON for N00bs is an open guide for first time attendees to the convention.

This guide is published to the Hacking and Coffee website @ https://hackingand.coffee/defcon-for-n00bs/

This repo allows people to submit changes to include, suggested docs, resources, etc.

I will update the site accordingly. As much as I would like to edit an actual ODF file, it is not practical to keep track of 
changes in github without a lot of 3rd party tools (which, as a doc for n00bs, is not a good idea).

I will likely break sections into separate files or directories (with diagrams, tables, etc all possibilities).

This document and its resources are meant to grow over time.

To all who contribute, I thank you.
To all who read this, I wish you luck.
To all who think they know something better, submit a pull request.

Cheers,

-Hon1nbo
