## Introduction to DEF CON
DEF CON generally needs no introduction. However, we are aware that there will be people not familiar with the security industry
and culture attending. Sometimes they are sent by employers, sometimes they are just curious and happen to be in Vegas. For
those who are unaware, all we will say here in the introduction is that the networks are some of the most hostile you will ever encounter.
The Wall of Sheep is real and easy to get on and this event is the combination of some of the most brilliant minds in industry, some of the most annoying pranksters, and (usually) well-meaning drunks.
The history of DEF CON and its background are generally out of scope for this repo, we recommend you UTFSE if you are still reading this and haven't moved on yet to the various sections.


## Categories
The repo is broken into a few different sections:
- Essentials
- Tips & Tricks
- Images

## Essentials
The Essentials folder has guides for knowledge that, as the name suggests, is essential for the event. It includes topics such as:

- Securing your tech
- Travel
- Do's and Don'ts of the event

If any of the topics presented are unfamiliar to you, read them before heading to Tips and Tricks.


## Tips & Tricks
The Tips and Tricks folder is for the submission of items that aren't essential, but make life at the con easier. Anything can go here if it helps out DEF CON attendees.

## Images
The Images directory is used for diagrams, references, or anything that does not fit well in the text portions of the repo. All images should go here, and be referenced by their correspeonding text.
