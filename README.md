# defcon-for-n00bs
## Introduction
DEF CON for N00bs is an open guide for first time attendees to one of, if not the, best hacker conventions.

This repo allows people to submit changes to include, suggested docs, resources, etc.As much as I would like to edit an actual ODF file, it is not practical to keep track of 
changes in github without a lot of 3rd party tools (which, as a doc for n00bs, is not a good idea). Use of a Git repo allows for 
a lot more people to contribute items no matter how small, without having to use any propreitary tools or collaboration 
environments.

## This document is meant to Grow
