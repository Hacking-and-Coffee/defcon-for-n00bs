#### DEF CON for N00bs - Essential


## Be comfortable & stay cool. 
Las Vegas is very hot. It has been 100 degrees outside at night during this conference before. So unless you really need it (or are trying to be zero-cool and have plenty of ice water), don't bring the trenchcoat.

## Travel Light
Try to take only the things you will need for your stay. Cargo shorts and a black t-shirt are the standard uniform for many people. Swimwear, sunglasses and travel-size sunscreen recommended if you're in to that sort of thing. The event usually has a pool party, or you may just want to take a break and relax whilst in the heat of the desert.

## Casual Vs. Professional
Again, keep things comfortable.
For the most part you'll want to wear casual attire unless you are on a corporate sponsorship that involves some fancy dinners or the like. While most things in Vegas are casual (especially around the conference), many restaurants and casino areas have dress codes.
Of those that have dress codes, they can usually tell you either via phone, posted in front, or in your hotel area listing if your room has one.
If you intend to stray from the conference for one of these then consider packing slacks and a button down (or at the least a polo), are recommended. However, Vegas can be visited any time of year and DEF CON tends to take up the energy one might otherwise use on hookers and blackjack.
