There are many things that we could list as "Do" or "Don't."
We could say do not get pissed on liquour and throw bottles at casino security. I think @hon1nbo wants us to assume that you know that.

However, these are specific to the event. We'll start with the "Don'ts" since they are more important.


*********
* Don't *
*********

- DON'T use ATMs. If you have to use one, choose one in the casino next to the cashier cages, as they will be more closely monitored to prevent tamopering.

- DON'T push someone into the pool without giving them a chance to remove their tech. It is a dick move.

- DON'T use anything you consider sensitive over the wifi

- DON'T leave your gear out of sight

- DON'T harass the goons. They put up with enough your shit so the event can go on as usual.

- DON'T use your real name (unless it is both exotic and you really don't care). Even if you are fine with people knowing your name is "Smith," how manyu smiths do you think there are? Lots. Handles are not only for anomynimity, but also so I can differentiate the 500 different Smiths you will meet.

- DON'T plug in random devices you find (unless you have a super good reson to trust them)

- DON'T leave your bags unattended. Be prepared to have everything strapped to you at all times. Zipper pockets are your friend, as Vegas is full of pickpockets.

- DON'T scan random QR Codes and NFC tags. QR codes are often seen in advertisements are often found around the con, and quite often people stick a code over the original and it links to an exploit

- DON'T ...

- DO stay hydrated

- DO shower/bathe during the event

- DO wash your hands

- DO change your clothes

- DO interact with people (these events you will learn a lot, even if you never meet them again)

- DO go to the villages and interact

- DO go to parties (even if you don't drink), this is a great way to meet people and play with cool tech people bring

- DO participate in some of the competitions (there are tons available and many are fun even if you don't win)

- DO relax. Don't stress yourself out too much.

- DO password protect your mobile devices (remove fingerprint auth and weak pin numbers for the con)

- DO ...
