Traveling to and from the conference involves the usual set of risks. Las Vegas (LAS) airport does have a history of
stolen items and bags at a rate higher than the rest of the nations airports so being cautious is highly recommended.

The best tip one can follow is this:
```
If you can carry it, carry it and only check bags when necessary.
```
There are many recommended bag types. Choose whatever you feel is the safest but do realize there are downfalls to each
type. 

**AVOID BRINGING THE FOLLOWING** (carry on or checked):
- Black upright with 2 or 4 wheels
There are thousands and thousands of bags running through the system at all times. Do not let your bag get lost because it
looks just like the rest of them. Do whatever you need to do to make it stand out:
- Name Tags
- Ribbons
- Colourful Duct Tape

It will make it easier to spot for an airport employee in the event it needs to be grabbed or found. Put a name tag on the 
outside of the bag AND inside of the bag. Put a unique item (e.g. rubber duckie, Hawaiian flag) into your bag as an identifier.

Some people may advise you to declare firearm procedures using a start pistol or likewise item. Please follow the TSA guidelines 
if you are doing that:

You must put said firearm into a locked hard sided container inside of your checked bag separately locked or inside of a 
locked hard sided case (e.g. Pelican) with a **Non-TSA Approved Lock**. You should be the only person with the key. At the 
counter or baggage acceptance counter declare you have a firearm. Different airports have varying procedures (e.g., the 
employee may have to walk you and your case to a TSA agent prior to acceptance, upon receiving the bag you may need to 
go to the baggage service office directly to pick up). You will get a firearm declaration identifier put into your flight 
reservation.

Look up local laws to see if it is lawful what you bring back (e.g., lockpicks) after the conference. While procedures should
be the same everywhere TSA at different airports do treat the same things differently. Prepare ahead and if you are worried
about TSA confiscating an item either check the bag or ship the item home.
