##DEF CON for N00bs - Essential

DEF CON, like any conference or convention, can be a stressful environment both physically and mentally.

### General conference health tips:

- **Stay hydrated:** Conferences are really exciting, but it involves a lot of moving around, hot rooms, and waiting in line. It is 
important that attendees stay hydrated. It is not uncommon for someone to have issues not heeding this advice, so drink some 
friggin water.

- **Stay hygenic:** There are a lot of people, from a lot of places, and almost certainly someone less hygenic than you currently 
are (except for that one attendee... that person is the worst). Con Flu (a.k.a., "Con Crud") is an actual thing, and it is likely you will get it if you aren't hygenic and have never been to a conference before. Bring some hand sanitizer and actually use it every now and then (or when you want that slimy grease off your hand from shanking another). Don't forget to shower. Conferences are full of stinky people. Good attendees shower. Good attendees aren't disgusting to be around and spreading Con Crud. Be a good attendee.

- **Take a break:** Seriously. It can be a lot of fun, but rest once in a while! What happens if you don't rest? You pass out and 
wake up in bed with a furry... so yeah, don't do that. Okay, okay... in all seriousness it is just a health thing. You likely will not wake up in bed with a furry (though I cannot speak for everyone on that).
