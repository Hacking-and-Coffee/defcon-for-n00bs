If you do not understand how to protect a particular piece of your tech gear, i.e., if the words in the lists below are gibberish to you, then you likely should avoid bringing that tech gear to the event.

---------
-Laptops-
---------

Laptops should never be out of your sight if at all possible. Many people choose to put on a fresh OS with bare essentials, and nuke the thing from orbit after the event. It's the only way to be sure.

In practice, you can protect a long term machine, and even a work machine. But you have to take into account the value of the data on that machine, and understand the implications of what you are doing.

Here are some general recommendations for Laptops at DEF CON, assuming don't want to nuke it afterwards:

----------------------
-Encrypted Hard Drive- 
----------------------

This should be a no-brainer, however if possible one should use Self Encrypting Hard Drives / SSDs. Software solutions like bitlocker and PGP disk store the keys in memory. This is problematic as computer interfaces with Direct Memory Access can read those keys.

If you ensure your machine is powered down completely when not in use, and always in your sight when decrypted, then this risk becomes manageable. However, it is still vulnerable to Con Booting beforehand. This is getting involved for the average punk at a conference, but if you bring a work machine (like for a company representative), then it is expected to have information valuable enough to perform this. Interfaces with DMA include Firewire, Thunderbolt, Expresscard, and USB 3.0/3.1

------------------
-Virtual Machines-
------------------

Any time you choose to do a challenge or anything "dirty" on the network, or with software provided at the event, you better be putting it in a virtual environment. Be cautious if you choose to allow this. Hypervisor exploits are rare, but have existed. 
DEF CON is the type of event where a zero-day for these might pop up.

However, in practice a hypervisor exploit is kind of considered the Holy Grail. If someone has a zero-day for this, more likely their usage would be against a target like AWS or selling it. So even though some punks have dropped big stuff before, I (@hon1nbo) personally do not worry as much. Most are willing to do challenges using a VM, but then again I generally do analysis of something that executes before I run it.

-------------
-Peripherals-
-------------

There are some peripheral items that are a must at this event. Many of the recommendations here can be substituted for other items, it is meant only as a general guide.

- Cable locks and related. While not the most effective control at events such as DEF CON, it is cheap and easy enough that you should have one for defense in depth.

- Encrypted external media. External drives should be encrypted unless you intend to share the contents. In reality, the only reason I personally bring one is to store data long-term from events without leaving it on a running machine.
    
- Power-only USB cables. While you should always use your own charger, bring a USB power cable that has the data lines removed just in case. You can also use a USB Condom to disconnect data lines. If you do not have one, vendors have some that are either 
transparent or not in sealed cases so you can see what you are getting.

- Harden your phone. Make sure your phone is not set to automatically connect to networks, and that any apps on it are not using insecure transfer methods. A rooted phone can be beneficial with the addition of ACLs on the su binary, along with application specific firewalls and API calls. Bluetooth and other technologies should be off unless you are sure that the devices have properly implemented security measures.
